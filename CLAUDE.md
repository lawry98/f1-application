# F1 Race Weekend Briefing Agent

A LangGraph agent that turns a Grand Prix name into a synthesised race weekend briefing, served by FastAPI over SSE and rendered by a Next.js frontend.

This file carries what you **cannot derive by reading the repo** — conventions, traps, and invariants. For setup, the tech stack, the endpoint list, and a feature tour, see [README.md](README.md).

## Where things live

```
backend/
  agent/       graph.py (pipeline), state.py (TypedDicts), prompts.py (LLM prompts)
  api/         routes.py (REST + SSE endpoints), models.py (Pydantic contracts)
  tools/       Mixed — see "tools/ is not uniform" below
  config.py    Every env var read in the app happens here

frontend/
  app/           App Router, one directory per route
  components/
    <feature>/   Page sections: landing/, briefing/, teams/, teardown/
    3d/          Three.js — only ever loaded via dynamic import, ssr: false
    ui/          shadcn/ui + vendored Magic UI — do not hand-edit
  data/          Static domain data (TEAMS) and the Team/Driver types
  hooks/         Custom hooks, use- prefix
  lib/           api.ts (typed client), constants.ts, utils.ts, team-utils.ts
  types/         Shared types, re-exported through types/index.ts
```

## Commands

The frontend is **pnpm**. `frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed; a `package-lock.json`
appearing anywhere means someone ran npm by mistake — delete it. Node and pnpm versions are
pinned in `mise.toml`, so `mise exec -- pnpm …` always uses the right ones.

```bash
cd frontend && pnpm typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
cd frontend && pnpm lint        # ESLint
cd backend  && ruff check .
cd backend  && ruff format .
```

Full setup (venv, API keys, both platforms) → [README.md](README.md).

## Environment variables

Backend reads `backend/.env` (copy from `env.example`). Behaviour on missing values is the
part worth knowing:

| Variable | Missing behaviour |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | **Fatal** — `validate_config()` raises `SystemExit(1)` |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Warning; news search silently disabled |
| `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` | Warning; weather silently disabled |
| `FASTF1_CACHE_DIR` | Defaults to `cache/` |
| `EXECUTOR_MAX_WORKERS` | Defaults to `4` |

`LLM_MODEL` and `LLM_TEMPERATURE` are **hardcoded constants** in `config.py`, not env vars —
changing the model means editing code.

Frontend: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `frontend/.env.local`, defaults to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Key technical details

**pnpm's `node_modules` is strict — no phantom imports.** Anything you import must be declared in
`package.json`. npm's flat tree used to resolve undeclared transitive deps by accident;
`three-stdlib` was exactly that case (imported by the 3D components, but only present as a dep of
`@react-three/drei`) and is now an explicit dependency. A `TS2307: Cannot find module` on a
package that clearly exists in the tree means it is undeclared, not missing.

**Build scripts need explicit approval, and one unapproved script breaks everything.** pnpm 11
blocks postinstall scripts by default *and* re-runs its dependency check before every script — so
a single unapproved build makes `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` all fail with
`ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`, which looks nothing like the real cause. Approvals live in
`frontend/pnpm-workspace.yaml` under `allowBuilds`; the `pnpm` field in `package.json` is
**ignored** by pnpm 11.

**The graph is not a flat pipeline.** It has four nodes, but `resolver` sits behind a
conditional edge: when `state["current_step"] == "error"` it routes straight to `END`, skipping
planner, tools, and synthesizer. Anything assuming the synthesizer always runs is wrong.

**`tools/` is not uniform.** Seven `@tool` functions live across four modules
(`fastf1_tools`, `f1_data_tools`, `search_tools`, `weather_tools`). The other two files are
plain helpers, **not** LLM-callable: `race_resolver.py` (used by the resolver node) and
`schedule_cache.py` (a FastF1 schedule cache). Adding a file here does not make it a tool.

**Tools never raise.** Every `@tool` returns `{"error": "..."}` on failure. The agent is built to
continue on partial data — preserve this or the pipeline loses its degradation behaviour.

**Streaming bridges sync to async.** The LangGraph agent is synchronous and runs in a
`ThreadPoolExecutor`; SSE events are emitted per completed node.

**SSE discrimination uses the `event:` line** from the SSE protocol, not field-presence
heuristics on the payload.

**FastF1's first requests are slow** — telemetry downloads into `backend/cache/`, which is
gitignored. Cold requests taking 30–60s is expected, not a bug.

**`gltf.scene.clone()` must stay inside `useMemo`** — without it Three.js re-clones the scene on
every render.

**The landing page composes, it doesn't contain.** `app/page.tsx` is seven imports from
`components/landing/`; the hero, features, and footer markup are not inline.

**`components/3d/index.ts` is dead.** Every consumer uses a direct-path dynamic import
(`import('@/components/3d/f1-hero-scene')`) to get `ssr: false`. The barrel re-exports the same
components but nothing imports from it.

**The teardown page** (`/teardown`) preloads 192 PNG frames (`public/frames/frame_0000.png` …
`frame_0191.png`) and maps scroll position to frame index via `requestAnimationFrame`. Its canvas
is sized `min(92vw, calc(82vh * 800 / 420))` to respect both viewport constraints at once.

## Code conventions

### Frontend

- **File naming**: kebab-case, no exceptions — including `components/3d/`. Component *names*
  stay PascalCase (`f1-hero-scene.tsx` exports `F1HeroScene`).
- **Exports**: named exports. The only `default export`s outside `app/` are
  `3d/f1-car-showcase.tsx` and `3d/f1-hero-scene.tsx`. `3d/f1-loading-car.tsx` is named-only, so
  its consumer maps it: `.then((mod) => ({ default: mod.F1LoadingAnimation }))`.
- **Shared types** come from `@/types` — *except* `Team` and `Driver`, which live in
  `@/data/teams-data` alongside the `TEAMS` data they describe.
- **3D components**: always `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`; server-rendering Three.js throws.
- **No `any` on SSE events** — everything flows through the `StreamEvent` discriminated union.
- **shadcn/ui** components in `components/ui/` are generated; re-add with `pnpm dlx shadcn add
  <name>` from `frontend/` (where `components.json` lives) rather than editing them by hand.

### Backend

- **snake_case** for all Python identifiers.
- **All tools** use the `@tool` decorator and return `{"error": "..."}` — never raise.
- **Logging** via `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` — no `print()`.
- **Config**: read env vars in `config.py` only; never `os.getenv()` elsewhere.
- **Async**: `asyncio.get_running_loop()` inside async functions, not `get_event_loop()`.
